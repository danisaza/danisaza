### Hi there! I'm Dan 👋🏽

I write full-stack software for the web. I like React, Python, skiing, and modular synthesizers.

I'm currently a software engineer at BetterOmics. We're working to accelerate life sciences product development by providing rigorous, validated, and scalable data collection and data analysis software products.

I studied Math & CS at Stanford.

**Please Note:**

The company I currently work for uses GitLab, not GitHub. If my contribution history appears inactive, it's because I'm using GitLab as my day-to-day tool right now. 😉
